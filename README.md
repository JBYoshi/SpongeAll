# SpongeAll
Quickly check out SpongeForge and SpongeVanilla together sharing a SpongeCommon repository.

# Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. If you already have a SpongeForge and/or SpongeVanilla checkout, move them into your clone. If done properly, you should
be able to run `git status` and not see any changes.
3. If you have both a SpongeForge and SpongeVanilla checkout, **remove the SpongeCommon directory from one of them**.
4. Pull up a system terminal (OS X/macOS/Linux) or Git Bash (Windows). `cd` into the repository directory.
5. Type `./init`.
6. Import into your preferred IDE.
